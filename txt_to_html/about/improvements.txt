- [ ] Make {{file.txt}} import a txt file in place into the document.
- [ ] Make a syntax for inserting python code '>>>'
- [ ] Redo the "text with a hyperlink" to be "(text){{link}}"
- [ ] Make line starts work --> "(or strictly after spaces)"
- [ ] Make subtext line that is empty behave like an empty new line.
- [ ] Adjust print format settings to make margins and justification.
- [ ] Create custom "ordered list" using manual trick that allows
      for the control of list item names in line.
- [ ] Make *all* new lines matter. Get rid of the Latex
      double-new-line for paragraph and extras are ignored.
- [ ] Extra new lines should be treated the same a new lines, for
      spacing out the contents of the file.
- [ ] Generate a "Table of Contents" with links
- [ ] Generate one 'test' file that demonstrates all Syntax.
- [ ] Processing is too slow, The amount of python logic
      per-character in the source document is too high. Appears to
      have quadratic complexity, but it shouldn't. Only need to
      process as many characters of the string as the longest
      syntax allows.

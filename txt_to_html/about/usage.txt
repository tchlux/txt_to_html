### PYTHON:

    import txt_to_html
    txt_to_html.parse_txt("<txt source file>")

### COMMAND LINE:

  The execution of the program looks like:

    $ python -m txt_to_html <source text file> [--online] [--no-appendix] [--no-show] [output folder]

  This outputs a <source text file>.html ready to be viewed in a browser.

  Default behavior is to use local resources for displyaing HTML and to output in the current working director.

  If the '--online' argument is given, resource files are internet-accessible and nonlocal.

  If the '--no-appendix' argument is given, the appendix section is removed from the html document.

  If the '--no-show' argument is given, the resulting HTML file is *not* opened in a browser upon completion.

  If the [output directory] argument is given, output file is saved in that directory.

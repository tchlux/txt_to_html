Low Margin Plots

# First header
Here is the example with a small margin:

{{figure.html}}

How does that plot look in line? This will be a longer paragraph that spans multiple lines unless you have a really wide screen. Not sure why anyone would have a screen this wide, but just in case this text will be a little bit longer to ensure that a wrap will happen and the next paragraph can be distinguished from this one.

Now here's another new paragraph, it should not be merged with the past, even if the past spans multiple lines, this one will have an extra gap before it.
